# CS156 Module 5, Week 13: Homework Assignment #4 (10 pts)
## Instructions
1. In this HW assignment, you will write your own transfer/activation function for the ANN that recognizes hand written digits.
2. Download the Python file named cs156_ann_examp_2.py from the Week 13 section on Canvas.
3. The _sigmoid and _sigmoid_gradient functions are on line numbers 207 & 216 respectively. The _sigmoid functions gets called on lines 267 & 270.
4. Pick a transfer/activation function from slides 17 or 18. Implement the selected function as a member function of the NeuralNetMLP class, then change the calls on lines 267 & 270 to your new member function.
5. For HW 4, report, below, if your transfer/activation function performs better after 50 epochs, than the sigmoid function.
