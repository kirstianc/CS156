CS156

definition of AI in class; representation scheme, a search scheme, and a reasoning scheme.
	- searching, representing, reasoning

intelligent agents/systems must have
1) representation - 

wolf, goat, cabbage problem (cross river problem)
- can store information into a data structure 

- kinda like 5D chess where there are numerous outcomes that lead to more

2) search

# of planets in universe ~ 10^20
# of atoms in universe ~ 10^50
# of possible chess moves ~ 10^110 (legal moves) <-> 10^123 (illegal moves)
	- there must be some sort of algorithm or decision tree where they focus on only the useful/needed moves

- there must be some sort of search scheme that lets you find acceptable choices in a reasonable time

3) reasoning - 

imagine you have 2 buckets full of coins, run up and down the stairs, what happens to the coins? they spill out.
	- how did you figure it out? you never did this action before? 
		--> you made an analogy to an experience you had

- there must be some sort of reasoning base; deductive, inductive, something to infer what could happen

setup python environment


min-max trees and related algo
- many states with possible moves being the subsequent level (each level is a state of the environment)
  e.g. chess
	- since there is an absurd amt of possible chess moves, you only go down the tree to a certain depth

Agents and Environments --------------------
- the agent function maps from percept histories to actions [f: P* -> A]
- the agent program runs on the physical architecture to produce f
- agent = architecture + program

The PAGE Process (for designing an agent) --------------------
- PAGE = percepts, actions, goal, environment
- tasks for designing an AGENT-BASED systems
	What will the agent need to perceive?
	What actions will the agent need to perform?
	What goals will the agent need or want to accomplish? ("aim" is what you want to achieve, goal is how you achieve the "aim")
	What will be the environment in which the agent will operate?

	PAGE example (automated TAXI) --------------------
	Perceptions? - location, destination, traffic, other cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, etc.
	Actions? - accelerate, brake, turn, honk, etc.
	Goals? - get to destination, obey traffic laws, etc.
	Environment? - roads, other cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, etc.

PAGE exercise (Financial Planning Agent) --------------------
	Perceptions? current financial situation, current trends on stock markets, news channels, political climate, etc
	Actions? invest, save, purchase assets (e.g. housing, land, etc.), etc
	Goals? achieve financial stability, retirement, financial goals, etc
	Environment? emails, financial instituation dashboards, financial situations (interest rate, supply, demand), etc
