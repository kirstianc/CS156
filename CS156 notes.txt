CS156

definition of AI in class; representation scheme, a search scheme, and a reasoning scheme.
	- searching, representing, reasoning

intelligent agents/systems must have
1) representation - 

wolf, goat, cabbage problem (cross river problem)
- can store information into a data structure 

- kinda like 5D chess where there are numerous outcomes that lead to more

2) search

# of planets in universe ~ 10^20
# of atoms in universe ~ 10^50
# of possible chess moves ~ 10^110 (legal moves) <-> 10^123 (illegal moves)
	- there must be some sort of algorithm or decision tree where they focus on only the useful/needed moves

- there must be some sort of search scheme that lets you find acceptable choices in a reasonable time

3) reasoning - 

imagine you have 2 buckets full of coins, run up and down the stairs, what happens to the coins? they spill out.
	- how did you figure it out? you never did this action before? 
		--> you made an analogy to an experience you had

- there must be some sort of reasoning base; deductive, inductive, something to infer what could happen

setup python environment


min-max trees and related algo
- many states with possible moves being the subsequent level (each level is a state of the environment)
  e.g. chess
	- since there is an absurd amt of possible chess moves, you only go down the tree to a certain depth
