From the required textbook
1. Read chapter 2 up to and including the Summary section on page 60.

CH2: Intelligent Agents ------------------------
2.1 Agents and Environments
- Agent: anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon the environment through actuators
- Percept: content the agent's sensor is detecting
- Percept sequence: complete history of all percepts detected by agent
- Agent function: maps any given percept sequence to an action (abstract mathematical description)
- Agent program: implementation of agent function (concrete computer program)

2.2 Good Behavior: The Concept of Rationality
- Rational agents "do the right thing" but how to define "right thing"?
    : consequentialism - evaluate agent's behavior by outcome
        | agent placed in env -> percept env -> agent program -> action -> env changes by action 
        | if outcome is desirable -> agent performed well
        | desirability = performance measure evaluating sequence of env states
    : better to design perf measures according to goal in env
        | e.g. vaccuum agent -> clean floor
            - if perf measure was amt of dirt, vaccuum might clean then dump dirt...
        | clean floor is subjective -> if avg cleanliness, agent could:
            - mediocre job constantly 
            - high quality job and long breaks (normal janitor)
- Rationality
    : depends on 4 things
        | performance measure
        | prior knowledge of env
        | actions agent can perform
        | percept sequence to date
- Rational Agent: for each possible percept sequence,  select action (expected to maximize perf measure), given evidence provided by percept sequence and built-in knowledge
    : rationality is distinct from omniscience
        | omniscient agent knows actual outcome of actions (impossible)
        | rationality maximizes expected performance
            - e.g. if crossing street (no cars) but crushed by door from plane -> rational or not?
                : rational because it was the best action given the info available
        | raionality distinct from perfection
    : information gathering - doing actions to modify future percepts
        | e.g. looking both ways before crossing street
    : agent must learn from percepts and actions
        | e.g. if crossing street and car comes, don't cross
    : autonomy - learn what it can to compensate for partial/incorrect prior knowledge
        | e.g. bring table to door -> check room (table is moved a couple inches) -> move table back to original position -> check room (table is moved a couple inches) -> repeat

2.3 The Nature of Environments
- PEAS description (task environment)
    : Performance measure - Goal
    : Environment - Environment
    : Actuators - Actions
    : Sensors - Percepts
- PAGE description (agent environment)
    : Percepts - Sensors
    : Actions - Actuators
    : Goal - Performance measure
    : Environment - Environment
    

2. Read chapter 3 up to and including the Summary section on page 104-106.


The above reading assignment is expected to be completed over a two week period. That is, complete reading assignment 1 during the first of the two weeks, and complete reading assignment 2 during the second week.
